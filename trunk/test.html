					<h2>How do I find items in GeoDia?</h2>
					<p>If you're looking for something specific -- an object, a site, or an historical event -- you can type a free-text search term into the Search box at the top of the screen. You will need to click on a radio button to indicate whether you're searching for a site, or an image. Then click on "Search" or hit the enter key. The results of your search will appear automatically on the map and in the "Results" tab on the right side of your screen.</p>

					<p>If you'd like to look at sites from a particular culture or in a particular region, you can use the "Browse" tab on the right side of your screen. There you'll find a list of the most prominent ancient Mediterranean cultures and a list of regions (defined as areas in which people are sharing objects and ideas, not by political boundaries). By checking the box next to a culture or region, you will generate a result set including all sites that are in that region or have that cultural value in one of their periods. Not all sites belong to the same culture throughout their history, so don't be confused if you see some sites in the results that you didn't think belonged to that culture. You can also check multiple boxes to bring up results from several different cultures or regions, for comparison. If you check more than three boxes in either category, however, you will need select sites by hand from the results to display exactly what you want (since there will be more results than can be displayed on the timeline).</p>
					 
					<h2>I don't want to find a site, I want to find an image. How do I do that?</h2>
					<p>You may want to find images of a specific object or building you've seen in a class or in a book. Remember, GeoDia is about context in time and space. If you're associated with UT, you might be able to find a more complete record for a single image in the DASe project. But if you want to see an image of an object in association with the site where it was found, and with other objects of the same time from that site, GeoDia is for you. When you carry out an image search, you will get a list of thumbnail results. Clicking on one will NOT show that image itself on the map and the timeline. Instead, it will take you to the SITE and the PERIOD associated with that image. There you can see where the object in the image was found or made, and what other material from that site looks like. You can search for an image by typing any term into the "Search" field at the top of the screen, clicking on the radio button for "image" under the search box, and clicking on "Search" or hitting the enter key.</p>

					<h2>I found some sites. How do I see the images associated with them?</h2>
					<p>You can call up the images associated with a site from either the map or the timeline. After you have found your site, using either the Search box at the top of the page or the Browse tab, you can click on the site's flag on the map. If you want to see images from a particular period, click on a period in the bar for that site in the timeline, and the image list will automatically center to that period.</p>

					<h2>How can I view a larger-size image?</h2>
					<p>You can view an image in full screen mode by logging on using your UT EID and then clicking the thumbnail of the image you would like to view. Unfortunately, if you do not have a UT EID, you can only view the thumbnails.</p>					

					<h2>Can I manage which sites are displayed on the timeline?</h2>
					<p>If your search returns a larger number of sites than can be displayed, use the "Results" tab to select which sites you would like to view in the timeline. If you click "show", the site will always appear on the timeline, whether or not it's within the bounds of the map on the screen. If you click "hide", the site will never appear. If you leave a site on "auto", it will appear only if it's within the map bounds, and depending upon an algorithm based upon your search criteria and site importance it will displayed or hidden.</p> 

					<h2>What do the different colors on the timeline mean?</h2>
					<p>Cultures that appear most frequently in textbooks dealing with the ancient Mediterranean world have been given their own colors, so that sites at which these cultures are present can be easily distinguished. There are many other cultures in the ancient Mediterranean, but the ones that appear less frequently in reference books appear simply as gray (there would be too many colors on the map, otherwise). You can see which sites are associated with which cultures in the "Browse" tab. The colors on the timeline and map correspond to the particular culture associated with that site during a given time period.</p>

					<h2>What does a striped bar indicate?</h2>
					<p>A striped bar indicates the presence of two different cultures at the same site at the same time, in a way that is recognizable in the material culture from that site. So if the Romans take control of a site in Greece, and Romans settle there alongside Greeks, the bar in the timeline for that site in that period will be striped green and red. This way you can find "Roman" material from a "Greek" site in a phase when both cultures are represented, or "Greek" material from an "Egyptian" site under Greek occupation, etc.</p>


				<div class='faq-section-title'><h1>Programming</h1></div>
					<h2>How does GeoDia work?</h2>
					<p>GeoDia utilizes faceted browsing as a mechanism that applies multiple search filters along different information axes, such as cultures, geographic regions, and chronolgical periods.  Results are expressed through a mashup of the Google Maps API and an interactive timeline API (the Simile project, developed at MIT), combined with image resources from the Liberal Arts DASe (Digital Archive Services) project.</p>

					<h2>Why was GeoDia developed?</h2>
					<p>Disciplines that study the remains of the past, like archaeology and art history, organize information (events, objects, monuments) along three major axes: time, culture, and place.  Along each axis, the information is often grouped by perceived connections and similarities: along the time axis, information is organized into "periods"; along the cultural axis, into recognizable historical or material "cultures" like "Greek" or "Egyptian"; and along the spatial axis, into geographic areas or regions.  Presenting all three characteristics as they relate to one another within a visual framework may be the best means of conveying contextual information to a student.  GeoDia was developed to help students make sense of the spatial, temporal, and visual complexity that characterizes the material culture of the the ancient Mediterranean world across several thousand years.  It is also intended to help students contextualize material in time and space in as many ways as they like.</p>
					
				
				<div class='faq-section-title'><h1>Troubleshooting</h1></div>
					<h2>I have too many results, and I can't see the things I was looking for. How can I display the sites I want to see?</h2>
					<p>Most of your searches will return more results than can be comfortably viewed on the timeline. You can find what you're looking for in two ways. First, you can zoom the map in. That will give you more results in the area you're zoomed to, just like Google Maps or Google Earth. Second, you can manually select which sites you would like to appear by going to the "Results" tab and choosing a view option ("Hide" or "Show"). If you leave the setting on "Auto", sites will appear according to their importance in your textbooks (so Athens, for example, will always appear if it's within the bounds of the map you're looking at) and according to the zoom level.</p>

					<h2>I want a certain site always to appear on the timeline. What do I do?</h2>
					<p>Go to the "Results" tab on the right-hand side of your screen. Look through the list of sites there. When you see the site you'd like to show, click on the "Show" radio button. Now the site will always appear on the timeline, whether or not it is within the bounds of the map on your screen, and it will appear on the map whenever it is within the bounds of what is on your screen.</p>

					<h2>How can I see more of the timeline or map?</h2>
					<p>GeoDia's webpage stretches to fit your current screen resolution.  To close the browse/results tabs, click on the double arrow on the outside upper left corner of the browse/results tabs</p>
					<h2>The map only shows me one or two sites. How do I see more?</h2>
					<p>As with Google maps, the closer you zoom into an area, the more site flags will appear on the map.</p>

					<h2>The timeline doesn't show any results after my search.</h2>
					<p>If your search returned positive results (as listed in the results tab), you should see a bar in the timeline that represents the first known culture for that site.  If you do not see a bar, try scrolling through the timeline until you see a result.</p>

					<h2>I found my site, but I don't see any images.</h2>
					<p>If you can see periods but there are no images attached to them, we probably haven't added any images for that site yet. There are a very large number of sites in the Mediterranean area, and GeoDia is a work in progress. We plan to continue to add information (sites, periods, and images) over time. We also welcome contributions from individuals who are knowledgeable in the field; we are happy to add sites, cultures, or periods and include new images on request. If you have a request please email <a href="mailto:arabinow@mail.utexas.edu" title="Adam Rabinowitz">Adam Rabinowitz</a> with Geodia in the subject line. We hope that this will become a tool that will allow researchers, students, and teachers to share information of this type more easily.</p>

					<h2>I selected a region and a culture. I know there are sites of that culture in what I think is that region, but I don't see them. What's going on?</h2>
					<p>Since we didn't use standard political divisions to determine the regions, the way we've defined a region may not be the way you define it. To see how our regional divisions work, visit <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=112577105384605223037.00046179f39f00a19f906&t=h&z=4">this Google Map</a>.</p>


				<div class='faq-section-title'><h1>Specific examples</h1></div>
					<h2>I want to find Pompeii, so that I can see where the site is and what sorts of things were found there. How do I do that?</h2>
					<p>Enter "Pompeii" in the search box at the top of the screen, click on the "sites" radio button below the search box, and click on "Search" or hit the enter key.</p>

					<h2>My instructor showed a picture of the Colosseum in class today. I want to see what other buildings and objects date to the same period in Rome. How do I do that?</h2>
					<p>If you know when the building was built, you might be able to find it by searching for Rome, and then scrolling to the correct period. If not, type "Colosseum" into the search box at the top of the screen, click on the "images" radio button under the search box, and click on "Search" or hit the enter key.</p>

					<h2>I'm generally interested in Punic culture. I'd like to see all the Punic sites in the Mediterranean. How do I do that?</h2>
					<p>Here you might want to use the "Browse" function. In the "Browse" tab at the right-hand side of your screen, check the box for "Punic". You can also use the search box at the top of the screen by typing in "Punic", clicking the radio button for "sites", and clicking on "Search" or hitting the enter key.</p>

					<h2>Actually, I'm studying ancient colonization, and I want to see both Punic and Greek sites. How do I do that?</h2>
					<p>Here you would definitely want to use the "Browse" function. Check the box for "Punic", allow the map to load, and then check the box for "Greek" as well.</p>

					<h2>I only want to see Punic and Greek sites in the Western Mediterranean.</h2>
					<p>Use the "Browse" function for this. Check "Punic" and "Greek" under culture, and "Italy/Western Mediterranean" under region. If you don't see sites you thought would be there, look at our region map <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=112577105384605223037.00046179f39f00a19f906&t=h&z=4" target="_blank">here</a>. You might need to check the box for "North Africa" as well.
